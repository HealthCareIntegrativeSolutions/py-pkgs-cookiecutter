**Cookiecutter UBC-MDS** is a cookiecutter template for creating a Python package using `poetry`_. It supplements the `Python Packages`_ book by `Tomas Beuzen`_ and `Tiffany Timbers`_ but can be used independently. It was originally developed for use in the University of British Columbia's (UBC) `Master of Data Science`_ program (MDS).
