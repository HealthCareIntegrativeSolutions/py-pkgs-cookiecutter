**Cookiecutter UBC-MDS** is a cookiecutter template for creating a Python package using `poetry`_. It supplements the `Python Packages`_ book by `Tomas Beuzen`_ and `Tiffany Timbers`_ but can be used independently. It was originally developed for use in the University of British Columbia's (UBC) `Master of Data Science`_ program (MDS).

-  **GitHub Actions**: Ready for GitHub Actions Continuous Integration testing & Deployment
-  **codecov**: Code coverage report and badge using codecov and GitHub Actions
-  **Sphinx** docs: Documentation ready for generation with, for
   example, **ReadTheDocs**
-  **Python-semantic-release**: Pre-configured version bumping upon merging pull request to main
-  Auto-release to **testPyPI** upon merging pull request to main
